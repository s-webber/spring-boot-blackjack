[introduction]
= Introduction

This application provides a RESTful API for the playing of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack[Blackjack] card game.

This documentation is produced from the project's unit tests using https://spring.io/projects/spring-restdocs[Spring REST Docs]. A future improvement could be to combine the documentation generated by Spring REST Docs with the information available from the project's http://swagger.io/[Swagger] annotations - possibly by using https://github.com/Swagger2Markup/swagger2markup[Swagger2Markup].

TIP: The application uses HTTP Basic authentication (BA) to control access to resources. When specifying a username and password any value for username will be acceptable and the correct password value will be `password`.
